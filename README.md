# Optical-Pumping
Performed data analysis on an optical pumping experiment for my advanced experimental physics class.

In collaboration with a fellow physics graduate student, we conducted an experiment to study optical pumping and
understand the basic quantum mechanics involved in single electron atomic transitions. We used a
Rubidium sample and light source to study the intensity of light absorbed by the sample while itâ€™s
being optically pumped and then depumped. Several depumping methods were investigated such
as applying a net zero-field on the sample and applying an RF signal. We were able to use curvefitting
algorithms to measure the Lande-g factors of Rubidium isotopes using a couple of methods
and compare them to their expected theoretical values.
